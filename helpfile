Tidy.py help

Adding filetypes to configuration:

Tidy.py uses yaml for its configuration so it is easy to change it by hand. However tidy.py also has built-in
command-line arguments that will allow you to add a filetype in a termial:

python tidy.py {-a, --add} {extension} {type of file}

example:

python tidy.py -a zip archives

if the type of file does not exist tidy.py will ask you where to save these in future
